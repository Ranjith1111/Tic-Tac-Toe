# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O but instead Xs and Os ,I used colours like Black for X and Red for O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their colours in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
